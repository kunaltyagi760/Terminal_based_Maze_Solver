# Terminal-based Maze Solver

A Python-based application for maze generation, solving, and visualization in the terminal.

## Key Features & Areas of Responsibilities:

- **Maze Generation Algorithm:**
  Implemented a maze generation algorithm to create random mazes with configurable sizes.

- **Pathfinding with Backtracking:**
  Utilized a backtracking algorithm for solving mazes, finding paths from the start to the end.

- **Visual Representation:**
  Visualized mazes in the terminal, marking the path and differentiating walls, open spaces, and start/end points.

- **User Interaction:**
  Integrated user-friendly options for printing paths, generating new puzzles, or exiting the application.

- **Solvability Control:**
  Ensured maze solvability by restricting the number of random walls to be less than or equal to 25% of the total cells.

- **Tech Stack:**
  - Python

## Usage

1. Run the application by executing the main Python file.
2. Input the size of the maze (n x n).
3. Choose to print the path, generate another puzzle, or exit the game.
